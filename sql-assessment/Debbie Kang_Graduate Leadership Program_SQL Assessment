#Question 1 Generate a query to get the sum of the clicks of the marketing data
SELECT SUM(clicks) 
FROM marketing_data;

#Question 2 Generate a query to gather the sum of revenue by store_location from the store_revenue table
SELECT SUM(revenue)
FROM store_revenue
GROUP BY store_location;

#Question 3 Merge these two datasets so we can see impressions, clicks, and revenue together by date and geo. Please ensure all records from each table are accounted for.
SELECT impressions, clicks, revenue
FROM store_revenue AS SR
FULL OUTER JOIN marketing_data AS MD ON MD.geo = SR.store_location
GROUP BY date, geo

#Question 4 In your opinion, what is the most efficient store and why?
SELECT (SUM(clicks)/SUM(impressions))*100 as CTR
FROM marketing_data;
GROUP BY geo
ORDER BY CTR DESC

#The store with a higher CTR is better because it means the store has a high rank with low costs. 

#Question 5 (Challenge) Generate a query to rank in order the top 10 revenue producing states
SELECT TOP 10 store_location
FROM store_revenue
ORDER BY store_revenue DESC
